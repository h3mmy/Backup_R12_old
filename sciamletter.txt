Mr. Eldridge,

  I pre-paid for my issues of both SciAM Mind and regular SciAM online before the first issue was ever sent to me. 
  
  The transactions I have made with "NPG*SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN" are $15.90 on 06/18/12 and $24.97 on 04/30/12.
  The transactions I have made with "NPG*SCIAMERICAN-SAMIND 800-333-1199 NY" and "NPG*SCIAMERICAN-SAMIND" are $19.95 on 04/27/12 and $15.95 on 10/03/11.
  
  I also changed my address on your online interface, although I may have not done so correctly (Please send me instruction on how to change my mailing address in the future) and have been living at
  
  3850 Coleman Rd
  Apt 111
  East Lansing, MI 48823
  
for the past year. I will now be living at
  
  6243 Endenhall Way
  Apt 7
  East Lansing, MI 48823
  
Please update my address in your records or intruct me on how to do so appropriately. Enclosed is a check for your requested amount, although I am confused as to whether this is for the issues I had already paid for or a continued subscription, in which case I shouldn't have a delinquent account. If you could clarify this for me, I would greatly appreciate it so as to not make errors in the future.

Sincerely,
Zachariah Aslam
